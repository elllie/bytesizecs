# 6/30/21 Update: Good things in store
You might notice that the content here is incomplete. Check back here in September for a new and improved format of this course! 

In the meantime, we'd love it if you listened to our two favorite episodes:

### [1-1 Ramen Noodles](chapters/1-PythonBasics/1-ramen.html)
Programming... is exactly like making a snack. (Really.) In this byte, we explain how and why this matters.

### [2-1 Computers aren't demigods / On the existence of bias-free systems](chapters/2-CSSecrets/1-demigods.html)
This is a phenomenal interview with expert [David Widder](http://davidwidder.me/) [@davidthewid](https://twitter.com/davidthewid) on the pitfalls of placing too much trust in AI (and computer systems in general.)

<!-- # Conversations about computing

Computers might be boxes of magic rocks, but they shouldnâ€™t be mystical. Byte Size is a conversational course in computer science. Weâ€™ll chat about fun topics and teach core concepts in computing in a way thatâ€™s palatable regardless of your background. Join our conversation to unlock secrets about the field of computer science you might otherwise only find out from being there.

Each chapter focuses on a broad topic in computer science, from **programming basics** to **computing and humanity**â€”all broken up into several short, easily-digestible episodes (bytes!) We also chat with a wide variety of computer scientists to provide additional insight on the topics we discuss.  [Get started with our first chapter here.](http://learncswith.us/chapters/0-Introduction/0-contents.html)

### About the authors
[Ellie Young](https://elean.org) ([@elliemyo](https://twitter.com/elliemyo)) is an undergraduate researcher interested in making computers and computer science more inclusive. She's currently looking for Ph.D. programs in usable privacy and security. If you run a lab and you think this podcast is cool, maybe shoot her a message?

[Matt Lepinski](https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/matthew-lepinski/) is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at New College of Florida. Matt's research specializes in cryptography and Internet security, but his favorite course to teach is New College's introductory programming course.

Ellie handles most of the production work for Byte Size. Matt creates most of the supplementary materials.
