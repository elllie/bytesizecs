## Byte Size: Conversational Computer Science

Computers might be boxes of magic rocks, but they shouldn’t be mystical. We believe that everyone is capable of learning to program. Byte Size is a conversational course in computer science. We’ll chat about fun topics and teach core concepts in computing in a way that’s palatable regardless of your background. Join our conversation and you’ll be able to call yourself a computer scientist, too.

## Structure of the Series

Each chapter focuses on a broad topic in computer science. Each chapter is broken up into short, easily-digestible episodes. 

In addition to the episodes, each chapter also contains practice materials and links to supplimental information.

This podcast is also available at:  ?? iTunes ??
