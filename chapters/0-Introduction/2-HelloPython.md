# 0-2: Hello, Python!

In ten minutes, you can be a programmer. This byte provides a tutorial for getting started writing code and building your first Python program.

We recommend that you start by start by listening to the episode and then check out our [Python installation resources](InstallPython.md).

## Installing Python

(Explain why we need to install a Python interpreter on our computer in order to write code in Python)

(Installation instructions)

Once you have Python on your computer, you should check out our example code below for a "Hello World" program in Python.

## Example: Hello World!

Our first Python program asks Python to print (display to the screen) the message:  Hello World!

#### 🧁 Writing a program that shouts "Hello World!" every time you learn a new language is a computer science tradition [dating back to the 1970s!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

In Python, this only requires a single line of code:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

You can create a new text file, type this command into the file, and then save it. We recommend that you name it `hello.py`. (You could also download this code as a <a download href="hello.py">Python program</a>, but really it is more fun to make your own Hello World program from scratch!)

Let's talk more about what `print("Hello World!")` is doing.
