# Byte 0-2: Hello, Python!

In ten minutes, you can be a programmer. This byte provides a tutorial for getting started writing code and building your first Python program.

We recommend that you start by start by listening to the episode and then check our our [Python installation resources](2-HelloPython.md).

Once you have Python on your computer, you should check out our [example code](HelloExampleCode.md) for a "Hello World" program in Python.
