## Terminal/command line syntax: How to get the terminal to listen to your commands

The terminal can be confusing when you first start using it. After a while it will become second nature. 

The terminal only accepts sentences in a certain format and gets really confused if you give it something else.

### Anatomy of a terminal command

Any given line in a terminal window will look like this:

1. The username of whoever is using the terminal. (Probably your name.)
2. The current folder on your computer where the terminal window is operating out of. This is important context because when you're opening files, you'll have to give the terminal directions on where to find those files *from where you are currently.*
3. A symbol separating that contextual information from the stuff you'll type in. Sometimes this is a %, sometimes it's a $, sometimes it's a > or something else. You can't type to directly modify the symbol or anything before it, but you can change your user and location through commands.
4. The command you are executing.
5. The thing you want to execute that command on or with.
6. Optionally, you'll also see "flags" at the end of a command denoted with a `-`. These are kind of like adjectives that modify the command you're giving.

Some examples of this:

#### Change the folder you're in

#### Run a Python program

#### See who owns a particular Web address (Mac/Linux only)

### Common mistakes

## Writing code and using the terminal is intimidating! Isn't there a less scary way where I can just click buttons?

## Who made the first programming language?

## How are programming languages developed? For what purposes are they created?

## What makes Python special?
