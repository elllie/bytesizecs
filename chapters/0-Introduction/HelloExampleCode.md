#Example: Hello World!

Our first Python program asks Python to print (display to the screen) the message:  Hello World!

In Python, this only requires a single line of code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

You can create a new textfile; type this command into the file; and then save it ... we recommend that you name it: hello.py

Or you could download our <a download href="hello.py">Python program</a>, but really it is more fun to make your own Hello World program from scratch.
