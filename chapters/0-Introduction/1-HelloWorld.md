# Byte 0-1: Hello, World!

Welcome! We’re Ellie and Matt. We’ve thought computers are super cool for a few decades now and we want to share everything we know with you. In our first byte, we clear the first hurdle of learning computing: what even is computer science, and why should anyone care?

We also chat a bit about what to expect in this series. We have a broad view of computer science and so we want to bring in topics that touch on the variety of problems that computer scientists tackle; as well as the effects that computer science has on society -- both good and bad.
