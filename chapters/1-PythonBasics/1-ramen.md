# Byte 1-1: Ramen Noodles

When Charles Babbage designed the first ever mechanical computer in the early 19th century, instant ramen wouldn’t be invented for another 150 years. So what gives? It turns out that writing instructions for computers is exactly like making a quick meal. We’ll explain how and why this matters.

## How to cook ramen

We start by writing some detailed instructions for smaller tasks.

Then at the bottom, we put it all together and describe how to make ramen (using the smaller tasks).

NOTE: These instructions are written specifically for Matt's kitchen and may not work in other kitchens.
They are written to look like code, but don't match the syntax of any actual programming language. (Programmers call this style of writing "pseudocode.")

### Accessing items in the kitchen
Matt doesn't have a pantry. His kitchen is organized using cabinets, shelves, and countertops exclusively.
```
HOWTO: findPot (returns: a pot)
    turnToFace(shelf)
    
    if shelf.equip.pots does not have a small pot: 
        stopAndPrint("Error: There's no clean pot")

    pot = shelf.equip.pots.saucepan
    return with pot
```

```
HOWTO: findRamen (returns: a ramen packet)
    turnToFace(shelf)
    
    if shelf.dryGoods does not have ramen:
        stopAndPrint("Error: We're out of ramen")

    return with shelf.dryGoods.ramenPacket
```

```
HOWTO: findScallion (returns: a scallion)
    turnToFace(window)
    
    if window.windowsill.scallionsJar does not have scallions:
        stopAndPrint("Error: We're out of scallions")

    scallion = window.windowsill.scallionsJar.longestScallion
    return with scallion
```

```
HOWTO: findEgg (returns: an egg)
    turnToFace(refrigerator)
    open(refrigerator)
    
    if refrigerator does not have eggs:
        stopAndPrint("Error: We're out of eggs")

    todays_egg = refrigerator.dairy.egg
    return with todays_egg
```

```
HOWTO: findSeaseme (returns: a seaseme seed dispenser)
    turnToFace(shelf)
    
    if shelf.dryGoods does not have ramen:
        stopAndPrint("Error: We're out of seaseme seeds")

    return with shelf.dryGoods.seasemeDispenser
```

```
HOWTO: findBowl (returns: a soup bowl)
    turnToFace(shelf)
    
    if shelf. does not have soup bowl:
        stopAndPrint("Error: We are out of clean bowls")

    return with shelf.bowls.soupBowl
```

### Boiling water
Suppose we already know how to turn on the sink and fill objects with water. The following code chunks describe filling a pot with water and boiling the water in the pot.

Matt has an electric stove in a kitchen island across from the sink.

The stove has 4 burners, each with a corresponding circular dial on the front of the stove. Each dial has a picture that identifies which burner it goes to.

```
HOWTO: fillPotWithWater (NEED: an empty pot, "pot"; returns: the same pot filled with water)
    turnToFace(sink)
    sink.fillWithWater(pot)
    return with pot
```

```
HOWTO: boilWater (NEED: a pot with water, "BoilPot")
    If BoilPot does not have water: 
        abort
    otherwise:
        Find(an empty burner on the stove, "ActiveBurner")

    until ActiveBurner.Dial is at setting.HI:
        turnDialClockwise( ActiveBurner.Dial )

    if ActiveBurner turns red:
        continue
    otherwise:
        stopAndPrint("Error: The burner didn't turn red like it was supposed to when you turned the heat on")

    Place(item: BoilPot, destination: ActiveBurner)

    Boiling = you see many bubbles covering the entire surface of the water

    until Boiling:
        Watch(water)

    until ActiveBurner.Dial is at setting.5:
        turnDialCounterClockwise( ActiveBurner.Dial )
```

### Chopping scallions
[Most folks call them green onions but they're really scallions.](https://youtu.be/O1vJ4sXetw4?t=56) You'll want to cut a single scallion into little rings until it starts producing little white coins at the root. The coins taste bad, but the rings are awesome.

```
HOWTO: chopScallion (NEED: a scallion, "theScallion"; returns: chopped scallion pieces)
    turnToFace(stove)
    turnToFace(counter.knifeBlock)
    if counter.knifeBlock does not have knives:
        stopAndPrint("Error: There are no clean knives in the knife block")
    
    ChopKnife = counter.knifeBlock.knives.topRightKnife
    take(ChopKnife)
    
    CutBoard = counter.cuttingBoards.smallestBoard
    
    Place(item: CutBoard, destination: countertop)
    Place(item: theScallion, destination: CutBoard)
    
    Hold(theScallion.stem)
    Hold(ChopKnife)
    
    while theScallion has green:
        Hover(ChopKnife, location: theScallion.top, position: theScallion.perpendicular)
        
        if ChopKnife.location is above hand:
            stop
        otherwise: 
            cut(theScallion, with: ChopKnife)

    scallions_collection = take(CutBoard.center.scallion_pieces)
    return with scallions_collection
```

### Cooking the ramen
The following code blocks describe how to open the ramen packet and cook the ramen noodles and flavor pack.
Note that the ramen packet makes two servings and so we use half of the noodles and half of the flavor pack.
If we were to cook all of the noodles, they wouldn't all fit in our soup bowl.
```
HOWTO: openPacket (NEED: a ramen package, "thePacket")
    turnToFace(counter.knifeBlock)
    if counter.knifeBlock does not have scissors:
        stopAndPrint("Error: There are no scissors in the knife block")
    
    RamenScissors = counter.knifeBlock.knives.scissors
    take(RamenScissors)
    
    Hold(thePacket)
    Hold(RamenScissors)
    
    RamenScissors.cut(thePacket.edge)
    
    if thePacket.edge has a hole:
        continue
    otherwise:
        stopAndPrint("Error: The ramen packet is still sealed")
        
    Place(item: finger, destination: thePacket.edge.hole)
    tearOpen(at_placement)
    
    Noodles = thePacket.inside.noodles
    FlavorPacket = thePacket.inside.miniPacket
    
    PlaceMany(items: [Noodles, FlavorPacket], destination: countertop)
```

```
HOWTO: addFlavor(NEED: flavor pack "theFlavor"; a pot of water "waterPot")
    turnToFace(counter.knifeBlock)
    if counter.knifeBlock does not have scissors:
        stopAndPrint("Error: There are no scissors in the knife block")
    
    RamenScissors = counter.knifeBlock.knives.scissors
    take(RamenScissors)
    
    Hold(theFlavor)
    Hold(RamenScissors)
    
    RamenScissors.cut(theFlavor.corner)
    
    turnToFace(stove)
    PourContents(source: theFlavor, destination: waterPot, amount: "Half")
```

```
HOWTO: cookRamen(NEED: ramen noodes "theNoddles"; a pot of boiling water "boilPot")
    todays_scallion = findScallion()
    scallion_pieces = chopScallion(todays_scallion)
    
    turnToFace(stove)
    half_noodles = breakFragileObject(item: theNoodles, amount: "Half")
    PlaceMany(items: [theNoodles, scallion_pieces], destination: boilPot)
    
    secondsToWait = 180
    wait(secondsToWait)
```

### Poaching an egg
This code block follows [Gordon Ramsay's instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHGO8ygUk0w) for poaching an egg, sans the dramatic music.
```
HOWTO: PoachEgg (NEED: an egg, "egg"; a pot of boiling water, "boilingPot")
    turnToFace(drawer)
    if drawer does not have a whisk:
        if drawer has a large spoon:
            utensil = drawer.spoons.largest
        otherwise:
            stopAndPrint("Error: I don't have a whisk or spoon to spin the water with")
    otherwise:
        utensil = drawer.whisk
        
    if drawer does not have a bowl:
        if drawer has a measuring cup:
            bowl = drawer.measuring.1cup
        otherwise:
            stopAndPrint("Error: I don't have a bowl or cup to put the egg in")
    otherwise:
        bowl = drawer.bowls.smallest
    
    PlaceMany(items: [utensil, bowl], destination: countertop)

    whack(item: egg, with: utensil)
    Place(item: egg.innards, destination: bowl)
    
    Place(item: utensil.end, destination: boilingPot)
    until boilingPot.water is spinning quickly:
        whiskClockwise(utensil)
        
    Place(item: bowl.contents, destination: boilingPot.water.center)
    
    secondsToWait = 100
    wait(secondsToWait)
    
    scoop(item: boilingPot.egg, with: utensil)
    Place(item: utensil.egg, destination: bowl)
```

### Serving the Ramen
This code removes the ramen from the pot and puts it into a soup bowl. It also adds the eggs and the seaseme seeds to complete the ramen. 
We also include some instructions at the end for safety where we look at each burner in turn and make sure it is off. 
This is just to ensure that we haven't mistakenly left any burners on, which would be very bad.

```
HowTo: ServeRamen(NEED: a pot of cooked ramen "ramenPot", a poached egg "egg", a soup bowl "ramenBowl")
    cooked_noodles = ramenPot.contents.noodles
    Place(item: cooked_noodles, destination: ramenBowl)
    
    until ramenBowl is full:
        PourContents(item: ramenPot, destination: ramenBowl, amount "Small")
    
    Place(item: egg, destination: ramenBowl)
    
    seasemeDispenser = findSeaseme()
    PourContents(item: seasemeDispenser, destination: ramenBowl, amount "Small")
    
    secondsToWait = 100
    wait(secondsToWait)
    
    Place(item: ramenBowl, desitnation: table)

    PourContents(item: theFlavor, destination: waterPot, amount: "All")
```

```
HowTo: safetyCheckBurners()
    turnToFace(stove)
    
    until every burner has been checked:
         Find(the next unchecked burner, currentBurner)
         until currentBurner.Dial is at setting.OFF:
            turnDialCounterClockwise( currentBurner.Dial )
```

### Main Program (The computer starts here)
Once we have instructions for each of the steps, the high-level ramen recipe is pretty simple.
Computer scientists spend most of their time writing detailed instructions for small parts of the problem. 
Then once each of the small parts works, putting them all togther is the easy part! 

```
HowTo: MakeRamen(returns a bowl of ramen)

todays_packet = findRamen()
[todays_noodles, todays_flavor] = openPacket(todays_packet)

pot = findPot()
filledPot = fillPotWithWater(pot)
addFlavor(todays_flavor, filledPot)
boilWater(filledPot)

pot2 = findPot()
filledEggPot = fillPotWithWater(pot2)
boilWater(filledEggPot)

todays_egg = findEgg()
PoachEgg(todays_egg, filledEggPot)

cookRamen(todays_nooddles, filledPot)

todays_bowl = findBowl()
ServeRamen(filledPot, todays_egg, todays_bowl) 

safteyCheckBurners()

return todays_bowl
```
