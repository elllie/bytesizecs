**[Download Chap1_Worksheet.py](Chap1_Worksheet.py)**

(You might have to click "Save Link As..." to download the file.)

Once your file is downloaded, you can open and run it using the [same method we used to create hello.py in Byte 0-2.](https://learncswith.us/chapters/0-Introduction/2-HelloPython.html)
