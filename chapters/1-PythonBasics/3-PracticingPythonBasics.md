# Byte 1-3: Practicing Python Basics

‚ÄúHello World‚Äù is fun, but it‚Äôs more fun to build programs that do more things. You should listen to the episode and then download the practice worksheet.

**[Download Chap1_Worksheet.py](Chap1_Worksheet.py)**

(You might have to click "Save Link As..." to download the file.)

Once your file is downloaded, you can open and run it using the [same method we used to create hello.py in Byte 0-2.](https://learncswith.us/chapters/0-Introduction/2-HelloPython.html)

# Addendum: It's all in your head

A lot of you have been confused (and slightly intimidated) about what to do with this file once you've downloaded it.

In [0-2](https://learncswith.us/chapters/0-Introduction/2-HelloPython.html), we followed these steps to make and run our `hello.py` program:

1. Open a plain text editor and write some Python code in it
2. Save it as a `.py`
3. Open a terminal window and tell it where the Python code file is
4. Then tell the terminal to run the Python code

These are the steps you'll follow every time you want to run any Python program.

This might be intimidating because it involves a lot of typing code into your computer like a hacker. (On Mac, the "Homebrew" theme for the terminal looks even more like hacker stuff ü§ì)

It's totally normal to feel like this is extremely technical‚Äîthat's because it is! It is a lot of text, especially if you're used to buttons. I promise that once you get started working with this text, you'll find that it actually isn't any harder than using buttons. (In fact, it's easier in the long run.)

.. some text about why there are two separate pieces (text file and terminal) ...
