# Byte 1-1: Ramen Noodles

When Charles Babbage designed the first ever mechanical computer in the early 19th century, instant ramen wouldn’t be invented for another 150 years. So what gives? It turns out that writing instructions for computers is exactly like making a quick meal. We’ll explain how and why this matters.
